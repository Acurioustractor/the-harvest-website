## 🌟 Restaurant Concept Development

### Inspiration: Shaun Christie-David & Plate It Forward Model
Drawing inspiration from Shaun Christie-David's revolutionary approach at Plate It Forward, where former banker turned social enterprise pioneer proves that premium dining and social impact are not just compatible—they're complementary. His model demonstrates:
- **$6+ million in wages** paid to marginalized workers
- **692,818 meals** provided to community
- **271 people** from refugee, formerly incarcerated, and marginalized backgrounds employed
- **100% self-funding goal** through profitable social enterprise

### Core Philosophy (Adapted from Plate It Forward)
*"Harnessing the universal love of food to break the cycle of inequality"*

### Guiding Principles
- **Mise en Place Philosophy** - Everything in its place (skills, people, purpose)
- **Cultural Celebration** - Like Shaun's journey from hiding dhal sandwiches to featuring Amma's Dhal proudly
- **Zero Waste Kitchen** - Circular economy in practice
- **Story on Every Plate** - Every dish tells a story of transformation
- **Community Table** - Shared meals building genuine connection
